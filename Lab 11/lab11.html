   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In the past few lectures, we&rsquo;ve discussed writing an interpreter in
   OCaml for a side-effect-free subset of Lisp, called <i>Pure Lisp.</i>
   For this laboratory assignment, you&rsquo;ll investigate a potentially
   efficient way that the interpreter could represent its environments. This
   lab is shorter than most others you have seen.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   An <i>environment</i> is a data structure used by a programming
   language interpreter: it maps <i>names</i> to their <i>values,</i>
   called <i>bindings.</i> The Pure Lisp interpreter discussed in the
   lectures represents an environment as an OCaml list of 2-tuples, like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>[(</tt><i>n</i><sub>0</sub><tt>,</tt>
    <i>b</i><sub>0</sub><tt>);
    (</tt><i>n</i><sub>1</sub><tt>,</tt>
    <i>b</i><sub>1</sub><tt>)&nbsp;</tt> &#8943;<tt>;
    (</tt><i>n<sub>j</sub></i><sub>&#8722;1</sub><tt>,</tt>
    <i>b<sub>j</sub></i><sub>&#8722;1</sub><tt>)]</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Here the subscripted <i>n</i>&rsquo;s are OCaml strings that represent
   names, and the subscripted <i>b</i>&rsquo;s are OCaml objects that
   represent the bindings of those names. To find the binding of a name
   <i>n</i>, the Pure Lisp interpreter searches this list until it finds
   the first 2-tuple with <i>n</i> on its left side. The binding of
   <i>n</i> is then on the right side of that tuple. This takes
   <i>O</i>(<i>j</i>) string comparisons, on average.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it possible to search faster? One
   possibility uses a list of binary search trees
   (<small>BST</small>&rsquo;s) instead of 2-tuples. If each
   <small>BST</small> is written as a subscripted <i>t</i>, then the
   environment looks like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>[</tt><i>t</i><sub>0</sub><tt>;</tt>
    <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><tt>&nbsp;</tt> &#8943;<tt>;</tt>
    <i>t<sub>k</sub></i><sub>&#8722;1</sub><tt>]</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Each <small>BST</small> associates many distinct names with their
   bindings. As a result, the length of this list, <i>k</i>, should be
   much less than that of the original list, <i>j</i>. Also, if the
   <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s in the list are approximately balanced, then
   each can be searched in logarithmic time&#8212;faster than the linear time
   that was needed for a list of 2-tuples.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This representation is perhaps a better match
   for the needs of the Pure Lisp interpreter. To see why, suppose that we call
   a function <i>f</i> with <i>m</i> arguments (the subscripted
   <i>a</i>&rsquo;s) like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>(</tt><i>f a</i><sub>0</sub>
    <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> &#8943;
    <i>a<sub>m</sub></i><sub>&#8722;1</sub><tt>)</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   To execute this call, the interpreter must bind each of
   <i>f</i>&rsquo;s parameter names to the value of its corresponding
   argument. It might do that by creating a <small>BST</small> that stores
   the bindings of those parameter names, then adding the
   <small>BST</small> to the front of the list that represents the
   environment. The body of the function <i>f</i> can then find the
   bindings of its parameter names in the environment. When the call to
   <i>f</i> returns, it can simply remove the <small>BST</small> from
   the front of the list, restoring the environment to what it was before the
   call.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   This laboratory assignment will deal only with finding the value of a name
   in an environment represented as a list of <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s.
   A future lecture will discuss how functions are called, and how environments
   for those calls are created.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following OCaml type definition describes
   a <small>BST</small> whose keys are strings and whose values are
   instances of the type <tt>'value.</tt> It defines two
   constructors, <tt>BSTEmpty</tt> and <tt>BSTNode</tt>. (You saw
   something like this in Lab 3.)
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>type&nbsp;'value&nbsp;bst&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;BSTEmpty&nbsp;|&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;BSTNode&nbsp;of&nbsp;(string&nbsp;*&nbsp;'value&nbsp;*&nbsp;'value&nbsp;bst&nbsp;*&nbsp;'value&nbsp;bst)&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Also, this OCaml type definition defines <tt>layers</tt>, a list of the
   <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s from the previous definition.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>type&nbsp;'value&nbsp;layers&nbsp;=&nbsp;('value&nbsp;bst)&nbsp;list&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Finally, this OCaml definition defines <tt>LayerError</tt>, which is
   <tt>raise</tt>&rsquo;d if the binding of a name can&rsquo;t be found.
   The string is an error message.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>exception&nbsp;LayerError&nbsp;of&nbsp;string&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   Using these, you must write a function called <tt>layerGet</tt>, which
   takes two parameters, <tt>layers</tt> and <tt>name</tt>. The
   parameter <tt>layers</tt> is an instance of the type
   <tt>layers</tt>, a list of <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s. The
   parameter <tt>name</tt> is a string that represents a name.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The function <tt>layerGet</tt> must
   search the <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s in <tt>layers</tt>, in order
   of their appearance, until it finds one that has <tt>name</tt> as a
   key. It must then return the object (the binding of <tt>name</tt>)
   associated with that key. If it cannot find <tt>name</tt> in any
   <tt>bst</tt> from <tt>layers</tt>, then it must raise the
   exception <tt>LayerError</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some hints. You might define a
   helper for <tt>layerGet</tt> called <tt>layerGetting</tt> that
   takes two arguments: the first <small>BST</small> in
   <tt>layers</tt>, and the <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s that follow it
   in <tt>layers</tt>. The helper first searches the first
   <small>BST</small> for <tt>name</tt>. If it finds
   <tt>name</tt>, then it returns <tt>name</tt>&rsquo;s binding from
   the <small>BST</small>. If it can&rsquo;t find <tt>name</tt>, then
   it calls itself recursively. If it runs out of
   <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s to search, then it raises
   <tt>LayerError</tt>. Note that both <tt>layerGet</tt> and
   <tt>layerGetting</tt> can be tail-recursive.
