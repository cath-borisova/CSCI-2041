   <b>0. Introduction.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   In this laboratory assignment, you will write an OCaml function that deletes
   a node from a binary search tree (<small>BST</small>).
   B<small>ST</small>&rsquo;s are commonly discussed in a data structures
   course, like the one that is a prerequisite for CS<small>CI</small>
   2041. As a result, this assignment assumes that you are familiar with the
   <small>BST</small> deletion algorithm.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>1. Theory.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   We&rsquo;ll begin by briefly reviewing <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s. A
   <small>BST</small> is a binary tree with zero or more
   <i>nodes.</i> A <small>BST</small> with zero nodes is said to be
   <i>empty.</i> Each node in a non-empty <small>BST</small> has a
   <i>key,</i> a <i>left subtree,</i> and a <i>right
   subtree.</i> The keys are totally ordered, so that if
   <i>k</i>&#8321; and <i>k</i>&#8322; are keys, then either
   <i>k</i>&#8321;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>k</i>&#8322;, or
   <i>k</i>&#8321;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<i>k</i>&#8322;, or
   <i>k</i>&#8321;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>k</i>&#8322;. The left subtree and
   right subtree are other <small>BST</small>&rsquo;s, which may be empty
   or non-empty.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now suppose that <i>k</i> is the key at
   the root of a <small>BST</small>. Then all nodes in the root&rsquo;s
   left subtree have keys less than <i>k,</i> and all nodes in the
   root&rsquo;s right subtree have keys greater than <i>k.</i> This is
   called the <small><i>BST</i></small> <i>property.</i> As a
   result of the <small>BST</small> property, a key cannot appear in a
   <small>BST</small> more than once.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the following diagram shows a
   tree that satisfies the <small>BST</small> property. Its keys are
   integers. Empty subtrees are shown with slashed boxes, and non-empty
   subtrees are shown with arrows.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
   <img border="0" src="bst.png">
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   The <small>BST</small> property lets us efficiently search a
   <small>BST</small> for a key, and it lets us efficiently add a new node
   (with a new key) to a <small>BST</small>. It also lets us efficiently
   delete a node from a <small>BST</small>, given its key. In this
   laboratory, you must write an OCaml function that efficiently deletes a node
   from a <small>BST</small> in a way that preserves the
   <small>BST</small> property.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>2. Implementation.</b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
   You must first define an OCaml type
   <tt>'key</tt>&nbsp;<tt>bst</tt> that describes a binary
   search tree whose keys have the type <tt>'key</tt>. Here is how to
   do that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>type 'key bst = BstEmpty | BstNode of 'key &#8727; 'key bst &#8727;
    'key bst ;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   The type <tt>'key</tt> may be any OCaml type; all keys in a
   <small>BST</small> must be of the same type. The constructor
   <tt>BstEmpty</tt> returns an empty <small>BST</small>. The
   constructor
   <tt>BstNode(</tt><i>k</i><tt>,</tt>&nbsp;<i>l</i><tt>,</tt>&nbsp;<i>r</i><tt>)</tt>
   returns a non-empty <small>BST</small>, with a node at its root. Here
   <i>k</i> is the root&rsquo;s key, of type <tt>'key</tt>;
   <i>l</i> is the root&rsquo;s left subtree, of type
   <tt>'key</tt>&nbsp;<tt>bst</tt>; and <i>r</i> is the
   root&rsquo;s right subtree, also of type
   <tt>'key</tt>&nbsp;<tt>bst</tt>.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using <tt>BstEmpty</tt> and
   <tt>BstNode</tt>, you must define an OCaml function
   <tt>bstDelete</tt>&nbsp;<tt>tree</tt>&nbsp;<tt>key</tt>,
   where <tt>tree</tt> is of type
   <tt>'key</tt>&nbsp;<tt>bst</tt>, and <tt>key</tt> is of
   type <tt>'key</tt>. You may assume that <tt>tree</tt>
   satisfies the <small>BST</small> property. Your function must return a
   <small>BST</small> that is like <tt>tree</tt>, and that satisfies
   the <small>BST</small> property, but in which the node containing
   <tt>key</tt> is deleted. The node to be deleted, which contains
   <tt>key</tt> may be anywhere in <tt>tree</tt>. There are five
   different cases that your function must handle correctly:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Deleting a key from an empty <small>BST</small>.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Deleting a key from a <small>BST</small> whose root has empty left and
    right subtrees.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Deleting a key from a <small>BST</small> whose root has an empty left
    subtree, and a non-empty right subtree.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Deleting a key from a <small>BST</small> whose root has a non-empty
    left subtree, and an empty right subtree.
   </p>
   <li>
   <p align="justify">
    Deleting a key from a <small>BST</small> whose root has a non-empty
    left subtree, and a non-empty right subtree.
   </p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">
   Here are some hints. First, since <tt>bstDelete</tt> cannot use
   side-effects: it must return a copy of <tt>tree</tt> in which the node
   containing <tt>key</tt> does not appear. However, for efficiency, it
   must not copy <i>all</i> the nodes of <tt>tree</tt>! It must copy
   only the nodes that are necessary. If <tt>tree</tt> is well-balanced
   and has <i>n</i>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 nodes, then <tt>bstDelete</tt>
   must work in approximately <i>O</i>(log&#8322;&nbsp;<i>n</i>)
   time.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it is not an error if a node
   containing <tt>key</tt> never appears in <tt>tree</tt>! If that
   happens, then <tt>bstDelete</tt> must return either <tt>tree</tt>,
   or else a copy of <tt>tree</tt>&#8212;as described in the previous
   hint.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the cases shown above can be most
   easily implemented using OCaml&rsquo;s
   <tt>match</tt>&#8211;<tt>with</tt> mechanism. Each case will have
   an expression involving <tt>BstEmpty</tt> and/or <tt>BstNode</tt>
   on the left of the arrow &lsquo;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&rsquo;. Most cases will
   have an <tt>if</tt>&#8211;<tt>then</tt>&#8211;<tt>else</tt>
   on the right of the arrow.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, many of the cases will involve
   recursive calls. They need not all be tail recursions. Maybe none of them
   will be! It is impossible (or at least very hard) to write
   <tt>bstDelete</tt> in a completely tail-recursive way.
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, for the last case, you may need a
   helper function that returns the minimum key in <tt>tree</tt>, or the
   maximum key in <tt>tree</tt>. (You will not need both.) Here is one way
   to write a function <tt>bstMaxKey</tt> that returns the maximum key.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <tt>exception&nbsp;BadEmptyBst&nbsp;;;&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>let&nbsp;rec&nbsp;bstMaxKey&nbsp;tree&nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;match&nbsp;tree&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;BstEmpty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;raise&nbsp;BadEmptyBst&nbsp;|&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BstNode(key,&nbsp;_,&nbsp;BstEmpty)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;key&nbsp;|&nbsp;</tt>
    <br />
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BstNode(_,&nbsp;_,&nbsp;rightSubtree)&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;bstMaxKey&nbsp;rightSubtree&nbsp;;;</tt>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
   The function <tt>bstMaxKey</tt> moves right through <tt>tree</tt>
   as deeply as it can, until it finds the rightmost node, and then returns the
   key in that node. It raises an exception <tt>BadEmptyBst</tt> if
   <tt>tree</tt> is empty, but that should never happen. (We have not yet
   discussed exceptions in the lectures, but we will soon.) It also uses
   &lsquo;<tt>_</tt>&rsquo;, which is OCaml&rsquo;s way to denote part of
   an object that must be present, but which we do not care about.

   tests, then submit the OCaml code for your function <tt>bstDelete</tt>,
   the test file, along with the results of the tests, all in one file. Put the
   test results in a comment at the end of your file. Your lab TA&rsquo;s will
   tell you how and where to turn in your work. It must be submitted by
